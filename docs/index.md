Kepler is a open source [geosocial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosocial_networking) general-purpose solution that lets users share favorite places and join discussions in real-time. It can be seen as a platform where users can interact with other open data platforms searching across [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/about), [Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/) among other sources.
The name as the best [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) tradition wants to remain in the space field, *Kepler* is inspired by [Kepler space telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_Mission) a telescope that looks further *new potential places in the space*, moreover the project organization is inspired to the first and largest open source project built in Meteor the old *Telescope*(current *VulcanJS*).

### Mission
Allows users to collecting and georeferencing places on a modern web-mapping interface, describe them accurately, create relationships, sharing with other users and create a social environment. In addition to creating new place you can import pre-existing objects from Openstreetmap creating a social layer above it.
A place in Kepler can be linked to metadata from different sources automatically, it can be anything that has a geographic location fixed or movable, real or virtual.

### Principles

* **fullstack**: developed 100% in JavaScript using the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) the best [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) fullstack framework.
* **realtime**: All events and changes within the platform are automatically transmitted from the server to the clients through [websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API).
* **geosocial**: The main user interface is a web map contains objects that represent places, users that interact with each other
* **extensible**: Development is based on an easily buildable plugins [architecture](http://docs.keplerjs.io/architecture.html)


### Expectations
In the near future Kepler as any open source projects will follow a community-driven evolution that will support it instead of the initial mission ad we hope it has growth beyond expectations.

"Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected."
Eric S. Raymond
